# BUGS

Known defects and limitations, and their status. Updated alongside PLAN.md at every
stage.

Format: `- [ ] B<N>: <symptom> — <where> — <status/notes>`

Every open entry below is a *characterised limitation* rather than breakage: the
behaviour is reported to the user, and no operation silently does the wrong thing.

## Open

- [ ] B5: `find_unused` and the call graph follow class-hierarchy dispatch as well as
  resolved calls: a Rust `impl Trait for Type` (supertraits included), a Go interface
  whose method set a type covers by name and arity, a TypeScript `implements`/`extends`
  clause, and a Python base class each fan an unresolved method call out to every
  implementation, tagged `field-based`, counted apart from resolved edges by
  `fr graph`, and named as the reason a symbol was spared. TypeScript additionally
  falls back to matching the method name alone where no `implements` is written, which
  is unsound by design and labelled `method-name` rather than `declared-supertype`.
  What remains is undecidable from the source, not unimplemented: a function held in a
  map, a struct field or a variable and called through it — nothing declares it a
  method of any type, so there is no method set to look it up in — and a name assembled
  at runtime from pieces no string literal spells. A symbol used only from a file that
  failed to parse is invisible for a third reason, and `delete::plan` reports that file
  as possibly hiding uses. Zig (comptime duck typing) and Bash declare no
  implements-relationship at all, so neither has a hierarchy to read.
- [ ] B13: an answer from supplied values inputs is only as complete as the
  description of them. Given `--set` but no `-f` (or the reverse) the competition is
  decided *given the inputs supplied* and says so, naming the channel it was never
  told about; nothing infers an invocation. Three narrower edges: `--set ports[0].name`
  and `--set ports[1].name` address the same key path, because the symbol index
  records mapping paths without list indices; `--set x=null`, which deletes a key in
  Helm, is ranked as a source that supplies it; and `{a,b}` list literals, `--set-file`
  and `--set-json` are refused by name rather than half-applied.
- [ ] B14: a CSS class named inside a TSX helper call or template literal —
  `className={clsx("btn", active && "on")}`, `` className={`btn ${size}`} `` — is not
  resolved, because only a plain string attribute value is captured. A rename of that
  class rewrites the plain `className="btn"` uses and leaves the helper ones; the
  textual sweep does report each missed site as needing review, so the result is
  incomplete rather than silently wrong. Resolving them means teaching the TSX queries
  which call arguments are class lists, which is a per-library convention (`clsx`,
  `classnames`, `cva`, `tailwind-merge`) rather than a language rule.

- [ ] B11: three SCSS forms fail under `tree-sitter-scss`, each refused rather than
  mis-handled: empty parentheses on a declaration (`@mixin m()`), empty parentheses on
  a call (`@include m();`), and a namespaced include after `@use 'x' as t`
  (`@include t.m(…)`). Fixing these is upstream grammar work.

## Fixed

- [x] B10: Helm values precedence stopped at the command line — whether a
  `values-*.yaml` is passed with `-f`, the order of several `-f` files, and every
  `--set` were invisible and reported undecided. That was a missing input, not a
  limit: `fr flow back <target> -f values-prod.yaml --set a.b=c` supplies the
  invocation, and Helm's order (chart `values.yaml` < each enclosing parent chart <
  each `-f` in the order given < `--set`) then decides it, winner marked and every
  loser — including a values file the caller says is *not* passed — still listed.
  With nothing supplied the answer is exactly what it was.

- [x] B12: Terraform lost the third and later step past an index traversal. A query
  cannot say "every sibling after this one", so each step needs its own pattern; six
  are now written, which is far past anything Terraform expresses, and a test asserts
  the bound so it stays a decision rather than an accident.

- [x] B0a: `LineIndex` invented a phantom trailing line for files ending in a newline,
  so `"a\nb\n"` counted 3 lines and an EOF offset reported a column past the last
  character — `src/span.rs`. Fixed: a trailing newline terminates the final line;
  columns clamp to the line end.
- [x] B0b: `.gitignore` was ignored outside a git repository, so scans of worktrees
  and exported trees walked `target/`, `node_modules/` etc — `src/scan.rs`. Fixed with
  `WalkBuilder::require_git(false)`.
- [x] B1: SCSS was parsed with the plain CSS grammar, so `$variables`, `@mixin`,
  `@include` and `@use` were all parse errors. Fixed at the root by adding the
  `tree-sitter-scss` grammar. A test asserts the CSS grammar still rejects SCSS
  syntax, so the split is real rather than cosmetic.
- [x] B2: a Helm template action in a structural position yielded a YAML tree
  reflecting no single rendering. Fixed for the analyses that reason about values: a
  key wrapped in `{{- if }}` now produces a stop naming the exact condition, and the
  condition's own `.Values` key resolves. Masking itself is unchanged by design — it
  is what keeps byte offsets valid — so the symbol index still shows guarded keys
  unconditionally; only provenance and stitch consult the guards.
- [x] B3: deleting a CSS selector left its `{ ... }` block orphaned. The delete widens
  the selector's span to the whole rule when it is alone on it, or to that selector
  and its comma when the rule has others.
- [x] B4: import liveness was name-based, so anything a language brings into scope
  invisibly looked unused. Per-language guards now hold back and report: Python
  `__future__` imports, `__all__` re-exports and dotted registration imports;
  TypeScript type-only imports, JSDoc `{Foo}` mentions, JSX pragmas and `typeof X`;
  Go blank imports and packages whose clause name cannot be derived from the path.
  Zig was verified to need none. Two real false positives fell out of it: Python
  `import a.b` binds `a`, not `b`, and `gopkg.in/yaml.v2` binds `yaml`, not `v2`.
- [x] B6: consecutive standalone Go `import "x"` lines were not sorted, because the
  `import` keyword sits outside the `import_spec` span and looked like unrelated code
  ending the block.
- [x] B7: Helm `.Values` references lived inside masked actions and were invisible.
  Fixed by parsing the actions: paths resolve through pipelines, function arguments,
  `with` scopes, `$.` and into `define` bodies reached by `include`. Fields of a dot
  bound by `range`, values reached via `index .Values "a-b"`, and computed template
  names are named as unresolved rather than resolved.
- [x] B8: Terraform splat traversals lost their trailing segments. `[*].id` and
  `.*.id` now capture every following attribute; B12 records what an index traversal
  still loses.
- [x] B9: `.tfvars` top-level attributes now produce `Key` symbols, so values files
  are in the index rather than needing provenance to walk the tree itself.
