# Development continuity

M4l is complete: all four fresh regex workspace trials pass, and the full cohort is retained.
The user authorized local commits. Publishing and pushing remain outside this request.
Production behavior last changed in M4k (`6d0928b`); M4l preparation is `811591e`.
The current evidence milestone changes recordings, replay coverage and documentation only.

## Current result

The regex task adds a documented public buffer-writing API by discovering and using an existing workspace helper.
It exercises a real seven-package repository with 227 Rust files and 5,553,380 Rust source bytes.
Only `src/lib.rs` changes, so this is not evidence of coordinated edits across packages.
Four fresh agents ran as two sequential pairs, without conversation history, shared solutions or human task corrections.
No trials failed, restarted or were excluded. Both arms used the same instrumented checks and cooperative tool boundary.

| Repetition | fr context tokens | File context tokens | Result |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| 1 | 11,967 | 6,113 | Both pass |
| 2 | 11,603 | 12,660 | Both pass |

Across both repetitions fr uses 25.6% more measured context.
Both fr agents use exact-name lookup, quiet-success checks and smaller history completion reports without tool failures.
The second file agent keeps verbose check output, accounting for much of the difference between file repetitions.
Skills and transaction reports remain fixed costs; repeated uncached project indexing dominates fr tool time.
These results establish working agent transactions, not general context savings or production latency.

Every trial passes both declared checks in original, changed, undone and redone states.
The checks cover 154 regex/regex-syntax library tests and no-default-feature compilation; integration and documentation tests are excluded.
The independent append/allocation oracle passes 3,174 cases in each project and each clean patch receiver.
Undo/redo restore exact tracked bytes and modes and preserve an unrelated later edit. Project and receiver indexes stay unchanged.
See the [workspace report](agent-workspace-evaluation.md) for raw results, source provenance, runtime details and limitations.

## Durable evidence

Never rewrite existing evidence when changing the tool, skill or evaluator.
Each cohort retains prompts, transcripts, scores, patches and its original skill snapshot, with manifest checksums.

- `tests/agent-eval/results/2026-09-07`: four initial strsim trials; interrupted infrastructure pilots are retained separately.
- `tests/agent-eval/results/2026-09-07-context`: four follow-up strsim trials after M4i; no pilots.
- `tests/agent-eval/results/2026-09-08-regex`: four repeated regex workspace trials; no pilots.

All twelve autonomous trials pass. Recording also supports scored failures; behavioral replay refuses failed trials.
Replay checks recorded patches and transition evidence without rerunning agents. Token auditing recounts retained payloads.
The initial and follow-up strsim findings remain in the [context report](agent-context-followup.md).
Controlled reports are separate: `tests/agent-eval/history-context.json` and `tests/agent-eval/regex/rehearsal.json`.
The regex rehearsal uses a prescribed solution and rejects three compiled negative controls; it is not autonomous evidence.

Temporary regex sessions remain under `/private/tmp/fr-regex-agent-eval-2026-09-08`, one directory per retained trial name.
The frozen binary is `target/agent-eval-bin/fr-workspace-eval`.
Its SHA-256 is `6eccc6da5db83d295fa447089f6a0337e69a3adf5633df59c4fb60193026e856`.
It, the skills, prompts, evaluator and oracle stayed unchanged throughout both pairs.
Temporary projects are disposable after retention; use repository evidence for replay and audits.

## Validation and commands

M4k passed 31 authoring CLI scenarios and the full native/WASM gate in `/tmp/fr-m4k-full-check.log`.
Capability coverage remains 311/311. Strict verification passed in `/tmp/fr-m4k-spec-verify.json`.
It reports twenty-two fresh source anchors and signature maps, zero obligations and 29 Lean build jobs.
These model and source-correspondence checks do not prove parser correctness or agent-authored behavior.
No production changes followed that gate during M4l.

M4l exact token auditing passes in `/tmp/fr-m4l-token-audit.json`.
The opt-in four-patch workspace replay passes in `/tmp/fr-m4l-workspace-replay.log`.
Default acceptance and documentation checks pass in `/tmp/fr-m4l-evidence-check.log`.
They retain sixteen harness regressions, eight earlier patch replays and the controlled history comparison.
Prose budgets remain 272 long sentences and 9,335 Rust comment lines, with other tracked categories at zero.

Use cached dependencies with `CARGO_HOME="$PWD/target/cargo-home"` and `CARGO_NET_OFFLINE=true`.
`tools/check.sh` runs the native/WASM gate; `fr spec verify kernels --json` checks strict source correspondence and Lean builds.
The separate deep audit remains optional unless a change warrants it.
Scoring uses `target/agent-eval-venv/bin/python`, tiktoken 0.12.0 and a checksum-pinned o200k_base vocabulary.
Reference tokens count the prompt and visible instrumented payloads once, excluding system context, hidden reasoning and billed usage.

```sh
target/agent-eval-venv/bin/python tools/agent-eval.py audit-tokens tests/agent-eval/results/2026-09-08-regex
python3 tools/agent-eval.py replay tests/agent-eval/results/2026-09-08-regex
CARGO_HOME="$PWD/target/cargo-home" CARGO_NET_OFFLINE=true cargo test --test agent_acceptance recorded_workspace_patches_pass_checks_oracles_and_exact_reversal -- --ignored
```

Workspace replay needs the pinned regex dependencies. Follow the bootstrap in the workspace report on a cold machine.
The integration regression is opt-in so default CI does not acquire this additional dependency requirement.

## Next steps

Use the retained traces to reduce repeated report metadata and skill-loading costs while preserving coverage, source bases, guards and reviewable edits.
Measure proposed reductions on fixed transcripts or controlled workflows before requesting another autonomous cohort.
Treat repeated indexing cost separately from returned-context size; these trials explicitly disable the cache.
A later paired task should require coordinated changes across files; the current larger repository task is still a localized facade addition.
Keep portable skill references selective and executable against the distributed binary.
Further authoring operations, M5 automated Lean adoption and M6 framework migrations remain open in [PLAN.md](../PLAN.md).
