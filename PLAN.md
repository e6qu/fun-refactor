# fun-refactor — Plan

Multi-language refactoring + code-intelligence CLI on tree-sitter, covering the funveil
language suite. Research and provenance for every design choice: see [RESEARCH.md](RESEARCH.md).

- **Crate**: `fun-refactor`, binary `fr` (provisional). Rust 2021, **AGPL-3.0-or-later**.
- **Repo**: `github.com/e6qu/fun-refactor`. Commits authored as `e6qu
  <2966430+e6qu@users.noreply.github.com>`; remote uses the `github.com-e6qu` SSH alias.
- **Languages** (12): Rust, Go, Zig, TypeScript/TSX, Python, Bash, HTML, CSS/SCSS,
  Terraform/HCL, Helm/YAML, XML, Markdown. Grammar pins inherited from funveil
  (tree-sitter 0.26 line).
- **Feature families**: standard refactors (rename, extract/inline, move, change signature,
  safe delete, organize imports) + analysis (symbols/refs, call graphs, entrypoints,
  forward/backward flow, config-value provenance).

## Design decisions (baked in)

| # | Decision | Rationale (RESEARCH.md ref) |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | Self-contained binary; no LSP dependency in the core. LSP delegation is a late optional backend. | §3, §6.4 — the unique value is where LSPs are weak; LSP drags in daemons/config discovery |
| D2 | Edits are byte-range splices on original source, applied descending by offset, validated by reparse + no-ERROR-node assertion. Never pretty-print. | §3 — formatting/comment preservation for free; beats gopls's known comment loss |
| D3 | One unified property graph, shared nodes, independent edge layers (`REF`, `IMPORTS`, `CALLS`, `DFLOW`, `PROVENANCE`), built incrementally per language. | §6.3 — Joern CPG model; queries degrade gracefully |
| D4 | Every resolved edge carries a confidence tag: `exact` / `import-qualified` / `field-based` / `name-only`, plus candidate counts on multi-candidate edges. | §6.4 — characterized imprecision is what makes heuristic systems trustworthy |
| D5 | At unresolved call edges, flow queries stop and downgrade loudly — no silent over-approximation. Summaries (stdlib/framework) can extend reach explicitly. | §6.2 — dev-tool honesty over scanner-style over-tainting |
| D6 | Config languages get provenance semantics (substitution/override chains, hop chains preserved immutably), not imperative dataflow. | §6.2 — deterministic evaluation models; fix Checkov's substitute-in-place flaw |
| D7 | Entrypoint detection is data (per-framework YAML catalogs, MaD-style schema), not hardcoded heuristics. | §6.5 — CodeQL MaD + OWASP noir precedent |
| D8 | Unsupported operation × language combinations are refused with an explicit error naming the gap. No silent no-ops, no silent fallbacks. | engineering principle; also user convention |
| D9 | Every command has `--json` output; mutations default to dry-run unified diff, `--write` to apply, multi-file apply is atomic (all-or-nothing). | CLI-native + agent-friendly |
| D10 | Do not build on stack-graphs (archived 2025-09). Scope resolution via our own locals-style queries; graph construction may use tree-sitter-graph if the DSL earns its keep. | §3 |

**Open decisions.** One remains: whether to add the optional LSP delegation backend
(Stage 8). It is the only route to type-correct method resolution in Rust, Go,
TypeScript and Python, and it costs server lifecycle management, per-language project
discovery, version skew, and the self-contained-binary property the tool has today.
Recommendation on file: skip it.

Resolved since: the tool is `fun-refactor`, binary `fr`; extract-function landed for
both Zig and Bash without needing a CFG; and TSX `className` handles plain attribute
values but not helper calls or template literals — recorded as BUGS.md B14 rather than
left as an open question, because it is a gap with known behaviour, not a decision.

## Language tiers

- **Tier A** — imperative, ecosystem-rich: Rust, Go, TypeScript/TSX, Python. Full refactor +
  flow surface. LSPs exist (future differential-test oracles and optional backend).
- **Tier B** — imperative, tooling-desert: Zig, Bash. Same feature shape as Tier A where
  syntax allows; instant best-in-class (no zls/bash-ls call hierarchy exists at all).
- **Tier C** — config/markup, string-keyed semantics: Terraform/HCL, Helm/YAML, CSS/SCSS,
  HTML, XML, Markdown. Rename/provenance/safe-delete are the stars; several features are
  structurally n/a and refused per D8.

## Reuse from funveil

Same author, compatible licensing — copy liberally, adapt aggressively. Every copied module
records provenance (source repo + pinned commit) in the importing commit message. Mechanism:
at Stage 0, clone `github.com/e6qu/funveil` at a pinned commit into a scratch checkout and
copy modules in; never depend on funveil as a crate (it's a binary crate and we diverge
immediately).

| funveil source | Reused as | Stage | Adaptation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cargo.toml grammar pins (tree-sitter 0.26 + 12 grammars, markdown fork) | dependency set | 0 | as-is |
| `src/parser/tree_sitter_parser.rs` | parse layer | 0 | strip veil-specific metadata |
| workspace scanning (walkdir + ignore usage) | scanner | 0 | as-is |
| test infra patterns (rstest, assert_cmd, cucumber harness, coverage/mutation CI) | harness | 0 | selective |
| `src/parser/languages/*` (12 per-language extractors) | symbol extraction | 1 | biggest win; extend symbol kinds for refactor targets (esp. Tier C) |
| `src/analysis/cache.rs` | index cache | 1 | rekey by content hash |
| `src/analysis/entrypoints.rs` | entrypoint detection | 3 | keep the 5-category enum + API; heuristics become seed data for YAML catalogs (D7) |
| `src/analysis/call_graph.rs` | call graph | 3 | keep API shape (callers/callees/trace/format_tree/to_dot, petgraph core); **replace** string-name resolution with REF/IMPORTS-based resolution + confidence tags |

Not reused: veil/CAS/patch/profile/token-budget machinery (funveil's product core,
irrelevant here).

## Stages

Each stage lands as one PR (squash-merged), updates PLAN.md/BUGS.md, and must pass all prior
stages' corpora. Feature work within a stage rolls out Tier A → B → C unless noted.

### Stage 0 — Substrate: parse + edit engine — **DONE**

**Goal**: parse all 12 languages; make and validate lossless multi-file edits; CLI skeleton.

Landed: `src/span.rs` (byte-native `Span` + `LineIndex`), `src/lang.rs` (15 language
variants — TS/TSX, CSS/SCSS and YAML/Helm split apart because they need different
grammars or handling), `src/parse.rs` (all grammars + Helm `{{ }}` masking that
preserves byte offsets), `src/scan.rs`, `src/edit.rs` (byte-splice engine, overlap
detection, reparse validation, atomic multi-file commit, unified diff),
`src/cli.rs` (`fr scan`, `fr parse --stats`, `--json`). 48 tests.

- Cargo project, clap CLI, `--json` global flag, tracing setup.
- Parse layer: 12 pinned grammars, `Language` enum, extension/filename mapping, parse
  diagnostics (`fr parse --stats`).
- Workspace scanner: walkdir + ignore (gitignore-respecting), language routing.
- Edit engine: `Edit { byte_range, text }` → per-file descending-offset application →
  workspace-level edit set → dry-run unified diff / `--write` → post-edit reparse with
  ERROR-node check (abort on regression) → atomic write (temp file + rename).
- Test harness: per-language fixture corpora, snapshot tests, property test
  "any applied edit set reparses without new ERROR nodes".

**Exit**: all fixture corpora parse; synthetic edit round-trips are byte-exact outside edited
ranges; diff/apply UX works end to end.

### Stage 1 — Graph tier-0: symbols, scopes, references, imports — **DONE**

**Goal**: the resolution layer everything else stands on.

- Symbol extraction per language (kinds per language: fn/method/struct/trait/impl; class;
  interface/type; tf resource/variable/local/module/output; css rule/`$var`/custom property;
  helm values key/named template; yaml anchor; md heading/link-def; xml id; html id/class use).
- Scope resolution: own locals-style queries per imperative language; scope trees;
  shadowing-aware use→def (`REF` edges) within file.
- `IMPORTS` layer: Rust `mod`/`use` (in-crate), Go packages (in-module), TS relative imports +
  basic tsconfig `paths`, Python module paths, Zig `@import`, Bash literal `source` paths,
  SCSS `@use`/`@import`, HCL module sources, Helm chart structure, HTML `script`/`link` srcs,
  Markdown links.
- Cross-file resolution for import-qualified top-level symbols; confidence tags per D4.
- Persistent index cache (postcard) keyed by content hash. **Landed later, in `src/cache.rs`.**
- Commands: `fr symbols`, `fr def <file:line:col>`, `fr refs <pos|name>`.

**Exit**: refs/def corpora pass including adversarial shadowing fixtures; cache invalidation
correct; every ref answer carries a confidence tag.

### Stage 2 — Rename (first mutation) — **DONE**

**Goal**: the table-stakes refactor, all 12 languages, each meaning the right thing.

- Tier A/B: scope-checked rename; cross-file via import-qualified resolution for top-level
  symbols; conflict detection (existing name in any affected scope → hard error, D8);
  method renames limited to `exact`-confidence resolution, otherwise refuse with candidates.
- Tier C binders (each a small string-keyed resolver):
  - Terraform: rename resource/var/local/module/output address; update every interpolation.
  - Helm: rename `.Values` key path → values.yaml + all template refs.
  - CSS/SCSS ↔ HTML/TSX: rename class/id/custom-property/`$var`/mixin; update `class=` /
    `className` string literals and `var()` uses.
  - XML: id/idref pairs; namespace prefix rename.
  - YAML: anchor/alias rename.
  - Markdown: heading rename → regenerate anchor → update in-repo anchor links, reference
    links, footnotes.
- Post-rename textual sweep (all languages): old name in strings/comments → report only,
  never auto-edit.
- Command: `fr rename <pos|name> <new-name>`.

**Exit**: rename corpus per language incl. shadowing traps; differential spot-checks vs
gopls / rust-analyzer / rope on shared fixtures documented; sweep report emitted.

### Stage 3 — Call graph + entrypoints — **DONE**

**Goal**: beat funveil's string-matching baseline with resolved, confidence-tagged graphs.

- `CALLS` edges per strategy (RESEARCH.md §6.4): Go package-qualified + CHA-style interface
  edges; Rust direct + impl-block receiver tracking, `dyn`/fn-pointer → multi-candidate;
  TS/TSX field-based (ACG) + annotation narrowing; Python PyCG-style assignment-graph (no
  bare name-matching); Zig name + `@import`, comptime sites flagged unresolved; Bash
  command-position + static `source` closure.
- Entrypoint catalogs (YAML, D7): schema `kind` × `threat_model` × per-language `match` ×
  `yields` × `provenance`. Starter catalogs: Rust (main/tokio/test/clap/axum/actix),
  Go (main/init/tests/net-http/cobra/gin), TS (Next.js/Express/React roots), Python
  (`__main__`/click/argparse/flask/fastapi/django/pytest), Zig (main/test/build.zig),
  Bash (script mains), Terraform (root variables = infra-input; SG/Service exposure =
  infra-exposure), Helm (values keys; Service/Ingress templates), Markdown/HTML mains
  (funveil parity).
- Commands: `fr callers <fn>`, `fr callees <fn>`, `fr trace <fn> --up|--down --depth N`,
  `fr graph --dot|--json`, `fr entrypoints [--kind K] [--reachable-from|--reaching <sym>]`.

**Exit**: zero same-name cross-file conflation on fixtures (the funveil failure mode);
precision/recall measured on fixture apps per language; catalog-driven entrypoints ≥ funveil's
detection on its own categories.

### Stage 4 — Flow analysis — **DONE**

**Goal**: "where does this value come from / where is it used" for all 12, with the right
semantics per tier.

- Tier A/B (`DFLOW`): statement-level CFG per language; reaching definitions (GEN/KILL
  fixpoint); def-use chains; `fr flow back <pos>` / `fr flow fwd <pos>` intra-procedural;
  inter-procedural = query-time traversal across `CALLS` with param/return binding,
  confidence downgrade at every non-`exact` edge, `--depth` bound, D5 at unresolved edges.
- Tier C (`PROVENANCE`): Terraform value DAG (var/local/module/output substitution,
  tfvars/default precedence, multi-pass expansion, hop chains kept); Helm values precedence
  chain (values.yaml < parent < user file < `--set`) → template use sites; CSS cascade
  answer for a selector/property (origin → layer → specificity → order, losers listed) +
  `var()` chains; YAML anchor expansion provenance; Markdown/HTML link + id/`for` graphs.
- Unified hop-chain output: file:line per hop, edge kind, confidence.

**Exit**: slicing corpora per imperative language; Terraform/Helm provenance validated
against `terraform console` / `helm template` outputs on fixtures; CSS answers match browser
devtools on fixtures.

### Stage 5 — Extract & inline — **DONE**

**Goal**: the extract/inline family, powered by Stage 4 dataflow.

- Extract variable: Tier A + Zig (expression boundary, insertion point, side-effect warning,
  name suggestion). Config analogues: SCSS `$var`/custom property from repeated value; HCL
  `locals` entry; YAML anchor from repeated node; Markdown reference-link def.
- Inline variable: single-assignment check via `DFLOW`; shadowing check at each use site.
  Config analogues: inline `local.x` / anchor / `$var` / reference link.
- Extract function: Rust, Go, TS, Python (ins→params, outs→returns, control-flow exit
  analysis; comments inside the region move intact — explicitly beat gopls here). Zig/Bash:
  decide per open-decisions.
- Inline call: strict preconditions (single return, no shadowing collisions, effect-order
  preserved); refuse loudly otherwise per D8. Helm: extract named template to `_helpers.tpl`.
- Commands: `fr extract var|fn <range>`, `fr inline <pos>`.

**Exit**: property tests — result reparses clean, extract→inline round-trips to semantic
no-op on fixtures; behavior deltas vs rust-analyzer/gopls documented.

### Stage 6 — Move, change signature, safe delete, organize imports — **DONE**

- Move symbol/section to file with reference updates: Rust (module → file), Go (same-package
  split), TS (move-to-file + import rewrite), Python (symbol move + import updates),
  Terraform (resources between `.tf` files — flat namespace), CSS (rules between partials),
  Markdown (section → new file + link updates).
- Change signature (CLI-native; LSP has no equivalent): add/remove/reorder/rename params with
  all call sites updated — Tier A + Zig; Terraform module variables (add-with-default /
  remove / rename propagated to every call site); SCSS mixin params.
- Safe delete: refuse if references exist (list them); flag-only mode for reports. Dead CSS
  selectors (vs HTML/TSX usage), unused tf variables/outputs/locals, unused values.yaml
  keys, orphaned Markdown link defs, unused XML ids, unused functions (via `CALLS` +
  entrypoint reachability).
- Organize imports: Rust `use` merge/sort/unused, Go (goimports-lite), TS, Python, Zig
  `@import` consts, SCSS `@use` ordering.
- Commands: `fr move <sym> <dest>`, `fr sig <fn> <spec>`, `fr delete <sym>`, `fr imports`.

**Exit**: per-feature cross-language corpora; safety-refusal tests (delete/move/sig with live
refs must fail with the ref list).

### Stage 7 — Cross-language intelligence — **DONE**

**Goal**: the queries nothing else can answer; mostly composition of existing layers.

- Stitched flows across file-type boundaries: Helm value → container env → `os.environ` /
  `process.env` read; Terraform output → consumed values; CSS custom property chains into
  computed use.
- `fr impact <target>`: blast radius across all edge layers (refs + calls + provenance +
  textual-sweep hits), grouped by confidence.
- HTML `id`/`for`/`aria-*` reference resolution (the gap vscode-html-languageservice leaves).
- TSX className richness (clsx/template literals) per open decision.

**Exit**: cross-language fixtures (mini app: Terraform + Helm + Python service + TSX front
end) with stitched-flow snapshot tests.

### Stage 8 — Advanced & ecosystem — **PARTIAL**: pattern restructuring, micro-rewrites and cascading cleanup all complete; the optional LSP delegation backend is the only item left

- Micro-rewrite tail (per-language `refactor.rewrite.*` equivalents: invert-if, guard
  clauses, de Morgan, fill-struct where syntax allows).
- Pattern restructure: user-supplied before/after patterns with scope-aware constraints
  (rope-restructure / ast-grep-style), plus Piranha-style cascading cleanup chains.
- Optional LSP delegation backend (`--engine lsp`) for Rust/Go/TS/Python: prepareRename →
  rename → WorkspaceEdit apply, capability probing, LSP diagnostics as post-edit check.
- Daemon/watch mode with incremental reindexing; editor integration surface.

**Exit**: scoped when reached; each item ships behind its own corpus.

## End-state feature × language matrix

\* Helm: extract named template. † Terraform: module variable add/remove/rename propagated to
call sites. ‡ SCSS: mixin parameters.

## Testing & quality strategy

Four layers, each answering a question the one below it cannot:

| Layer | Where | What it can catch |
|---|---|---|
| Unit | `#[cfg(test)]` beside the code | Local correctness: span arithmetic, negation, subtree hashing |
| Integration | `tests/*.rs` against the library | A refactoring's resulting bytes, per language |
| End-to-end | `tests/cli.rs`, `tests/test_pyramid.rs` | Argument parsing, path resolution, exit codes, the text a person reads |
| Real repositories | helm/helm, grafana/grafana, by hand | What people actually write, which is not what fixtures imagine |

The end-to-end layer exists because two bugs were found living in it, both of the
kind that answers wrongly while looking like it worked: `--path` filters built by
joining the default root `.` matched nothing and reported that as nothing found, and
target paths were read from the shell's directory rather than the workspace `-C`
names. Neither was visible from the library API.

`tests/test_pyramid.rs` enforces the layer rather than merely occupying it: it reads
the subcommand list out of `fr --help` and fails if any command has no end-to-end
test. That guard is verified to bite — removing a command's entry fails the build
with its name. It also asserts that no command writes to the workspace without
`--write`, which is the promise the whole CLI rests on.

The fourth layer is deliberately not automated. Pinning a 500 MB clone into CI buys
less than the measurements already recorded in BUGS.md, and the bugs it found were
found by *reading* output — a silent guard-clause that moved code out from under its
condition, a dead-code report that was 84% false positives — which no assertion
written in advance would have looked for.


- **Fixture corpora**: per language × per feature, including adversarial cases (shadowing,
  aliased imports, same-name symbols across files, dynamic dispatch).
- **Property tests**: every applied edit set reparses with no new ERROR nodes; bytes outside
  edited ranges unchanged; rename A→B→A round-trips byte-exact; extract→inline round-trips.
- **Differential oracles** (test-time only, not runtime deps): gopls `rename`,
  rust-analyzer, rope, tsserver on shared fixtures; `terraform console` / `helm template`
  for provenance answers.
- **Honesty gates**: no edge without a confidence tag; no command silently succeeding with
  partial coverage — partial results must say what was skipped and why (D5/D8).
- CI from Stage 0; coverage tracked; mutation testing once the edit engine stabilizes
  (funveil precedent).

## Risks

- **Grammar quality variance**: shipped tree-sitter grammars differ in fidelity (esp. Zig,
  HCL forks, markdown). Mitigation: pin versions, fixture-corpus gate per grammar upgrade.
- **Scope-query authoring cost**: own locals-style queries per language is real per-language
  work (stack-graphs' lesson). Mitigation: only imperative languages need true scope trees;
  Tier C binders are string-keyed.
- **Method/dispatch rename correctness ceiling** without types: bounded by D4/D8 (refuse or
  present candidates rather than guess).
- **Helm templating is text-level YAML**: `{{ }}` breaks YAML parsing. Mitigation: parse
  templates with the funveil approach (tree-sitter YAML + template-token layer); treat
  render-dependent structures as unresolved, loudly.
- **Scope creep across 12 × 17 features**: the matrix's — cells are commitments to refuse,
  not gaps to fill; tbd cells resolve via open decisions, not silent drift.

## Progress log

Every stage is complete except the optional LSP delegation backend, and every
capability a language can meaningfully support is built: **231 of 315 capability ×
language pairs supported, 84 not applicable, none refused.**

The matrix is no longer maintained by hand. `src/capabilities.rs` computes it by
asking each refactoring's own predicate, `fr capabilities` prints it with the reason
attached to every non-supported cell, and a test asserts the README matches. That
exists because the hand-written version drifted twice — once hiding 27 unbuilt cells,
once publishing six working ones as refused.

Open limitations are in BUGS.md. All five are characterised rather than silent, and
none is a missing feature: reachability under dynamic dispatch (inherent), Helm
values passed on a command line (invisible to a workspace scan), CSS classes named
inside TSX helper calls (a per-library convention, measured), SCSS forms the grammar
does not cover (upstream), and `tree-sitter-go` parsing a user-defined `new` as the
builtin (upstream).

### What running it on real code found

The fixture corpora test what we thought to write down. Running the tool over
grafana/grafana (16,525 files, 10.9s) and helm/helm found ten defects that 1,200
tests did not, and two of them changed program meaning while parsing cleanly — the
class no reparse check can catch:

- `guard-clause` hoisted code out from under the `if` guarding it in Go. **1,258 of
  1,498 applications over 250 files of `pkg/services` were wrong** (84%); the cause
  was a grammar wrapper node counted as a statement, in a predicate that had been
  copied into two modules and drifted.
- de Morgan dropped the brackets its result needed, turning `x && !(a && b)` into
  `x && !a || !b`.

The rest were loud but real: micro-rewrites published for seven languages and working
in three, `extract --function` emitting `x: : number`, and moves producing files that
parse and do not compile. BUGS.md B16–B25 records each with its measurement.

The lesson is recorded here because it should shape what gets tested next: a
capability matrix derived from code predicates proves a refactoring is *reachable*
for a language, not that it *works* there. The rewrites and extract-function now have
per-language tests that apply the operation and reparse the result, which is what
caught these once the shape was known. Extending that pattern to the remaining
operations is the highest-value work left, and running against a second large
codebase in a different language mix is how the next ten will be found.

### What the playground found

Compiling the same analysis to WebAssembly and driving every capability from a
browser found five more, and the shape of them is worth recording: **none was a bug
in an analysis.** Each was a place where the browser and the terminal disagreed
because a second caller had been written and had made a different choice.

- `find_unused` takes its roots as a slice, and the browser passed `&[]` where the
  terminal passed a detected catalog. Nothing runs, so everything unexported is dead:
  twenty extra findings, including every `#[test]`. The roots are a type now, and an
  empty one has to be asked for by name.
- Every *read* went through the virtual filesystem; the six `Path::exists` calls did
  not, and there is no filesystem in a browser, so each quietly answered false.
- The virtual filesystem itself was one global map, so a second workspace silently
  became the first one's bytes.

Two of the three are now checked by a test that reads the source, because neither is
expressible in the type system and both had already happened once. The third is a
newtype. The general lesson: a second frontend is a good bug-finder precisely because
it re-makes every decision the first one made implicitly — and the decisions that
were never written down are the ones it gets wrong.

The browser API has no `cargo test` — `src/wasm.rs` compiles only for `wasm32` — so
`web/test/api.mjs` drives all twenty-nine of its methods against a bundled
fifteen-language workspace, in Node, using the wasm the site ships. CI runs it.

Commands: `scan`, `parse`, `symbols`, `def`, `refs`, `rename`, `extract`, `inline`,
`signature`, `move`, `delete`, `unused`, `duplicates`, `imports`, `restructure`,
`rewrite`, `remove-flag`, `callers`, `callees`, `graph`, `flow`, `impact`, `stitch`,
`entrypoints`, `capabilities`, `cache`.
